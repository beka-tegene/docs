{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

## System requirements

- [Node.js 18.18](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Automatic installation

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using [`create-next-app`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```txt filename="Terminal"
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`?  No / Yes
Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, [`create-next-app`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Open your `package.json` file and add the following `scripts`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev`: runs [`next dev`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-dev-options) to start Next.js in development mode.
- `build`: runs [`next build`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-build-options) to build the application for production usage.
- `start`: runs [`next start`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-start-options) to start a Next.js production server.
- `lint`: runs [`next lint`](/docs/app/api-reference/cli/next#next-lint-options) to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.


### Create the `public` folder (optional)

You can optionally create a [`public` folder](/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) at the root of your project to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

## Run the development server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
3. Edit the `app/page.tsx` `pages/index.tsx` file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.

## Set up TypeScript

> Minimum TypeScript version: `v4.5.2`

Next.js comes with built-in TypeScript support. To add TypeScript to your project, rename a file to `.ts` / `.tsx`. Run `next dev`, Next.js will automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.


See the [TypeScript configuration](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/typescript) page for more information on how to use TypeScript in your project.

## Set up ESLint

Next.js comes with built-in ESLint, automatically installing the necessary packages and configuring the proper settings when you create a new project with `create-next-app`.

To add ESLint to an existing project, add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

Then, run `npm run lint` and you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.

```bash filename="Terminal"
npm run lint
```

You'll see a prompt like this:

> ? How would you like to configure ESLint?
>
> ❯ Strict (recommended)  
> Base  
> Cancel

- **Strict**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter Core Web Vitals rule-set. This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.
- **Base**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.
- **Cancel**: Does not include any ESLint configuration. Only select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.

If either of the two configuration options are selected, Next.js will automatically install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` as dependencies in your application and create an `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.

You can now run `next lint` every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (`next build`). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.

See the [ESLint Plugin](/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/eslint) page for more information on how to configure ESLint in your project.

## Set up Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases

Next.js has in-built support for the `"paths"` and `"baseUrl"` options of `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` files. These options allow you to alias project directories to absolute paths, making it easier to import modules. For example:

```jsx
// Before
import { Button } from '../../../components/button'

// After
import { Button } from '@/components/button'
```

To configure absolute imports, add the `baseUrl` configuration option to your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file. For example:

```json filename="tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src/"
  }
}
```

In addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `"paths"` option to `"alias"` module paths.

For example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:

```json filename="tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src/",
    "paths": {
      "@/styles/*": ["styles/*"],
      "@/components/*": ["components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each of the `"paths"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location. For example:

```tsx filename="src/app/page.tsx" switcher
import Button from '@/components/button'
import '@/styles/styles.css'

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <Button />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```jsx filename="src/app/page.js" switcher
import Button from '@/components/button'
import '@/styles/styles.css'

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <Button />
    </div>
  )
}
```
